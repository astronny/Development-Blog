What I have learnt in Interactive Development(ID):

<h1>Week 1: What a good website embodies; How to make Replit and Github accounts; What Replit and Github are used for:</h1>

I learnt that a good website embodies many factors, some include having a clear and concise message, visually appealing design and easy navigation.

I learnt that GitHub and Replit are both tools that are used by software developers. GitHub is a website where developers can store their code and work on software projects with other people. It has a lot of cool features, like bug tracking and project management, that make it easy for developers to keep track of what's going on with their projects. And because it uses the Git version control system, developers can see exactly what changes have been made to their code, and by whom.

Replit, on the other hand, is a tool that lets developers write and run code right in their web browser. It has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for developers to get up and running, and it supports a bunch of different programming languages. Developers can work on projects with other people and see what changes have been made because it has built-in support for version control, just like they can on GitHub.

So, in a nutshell, i learnt that GitHub is a place for developers to work on software projects with others, while Replit is a place for developers to write and run their own codes.

<h1>Week 2: Semantic CSS</h1>

During the second week, I learned about semantic CSS, which is a way of writing CSS that makes your code more meaningful and easier to understand. It's like giving your HTML elements labels that describe what they are and what they're used for. Using semantic CSS makes code more organized, easier to maintain, and easier for others to understand.

<h1>Week 3: More semantic CSS, forms, flexboxes, rgba, and others</h1>

Week 3 was all about using semantic CSS to customize forms, create flexible designs with Flexbox, and use RGBA to specify colors and their transparency.

To summarise what i learnt: 

Forms are a key part of many websites and applications, and CSS can be used to style and customize form elements by changing the appearance of input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more, making forms look more attractive and user-friendly. Flexbox is a powerful layout tool in CSS that allows people to create flexible, responsive designs. It is ideal for building complex layouts that need to adapt to different screen sizes. RGBA is a color model in CSS that allows me to specify colors using red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) values, giving me more control over the opacity of colours. I can even make subtle gradients amongst other effects!

<h1>Week 4: Responsive images for flexible layouts</h1>

I mainly touched on srcset:

  Srcset is a HTML attribute that allows me to specify multiple image sources and sizes for a single image element, which is useful for creating flexible and responsive designs that can adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

<h1>Week 5: Basic Javascript</h1>

Learnt about the foundations of Javascript:

  JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive web pages. It's executed by web browsers and allows me to add interactivity, animation, amongst other dynamic elements to my website. JavaScript is used to manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user input, perform calculations, and interact with web servers. Some key concepts in JavaScript include variables (used to store values), functions (used to perform actions), and control structures like loops and conditionals (used to control program flow). To use JavaScript, people can include it in their HTML code using <script> tags, either by writing code directly in the HTML file or by linking to an external JavaScript file (the latter is better for huge amounts of javascript).

<h1>Week 6: Javascript objects</h1>

Week 6 focused on JavaScript objects, which are collections of properties and values, and methods that manipulate data in complex ways. Objects are a fundamental part of many JavaScript libraries and frameworks and can be created using object literal syntax (using '{}'), or by using the object constructor. Properties can be added or accessed using dot notation or bracket notation. Bracket notation allows me to access properties with special characters in their names, while I cannot do this with dot notation. Objects can also have methods, which are functions that belong to the object and can be called using dot notation. Objects can be used to store and manipulate data in complex ways. 
  
<h1>Week 7: DOM</h1>

In week 7, I learned about the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.  It represents the document as a tree of objects, where each object represents an element, attribute, or piece of text in the document. Using JavaScript, the DOM allows us to manipulate the document structure, such as adding or removing elements, modifying attributes, and changing styles, as well as responding to user interactions. The DOM is a key tool for creating dynamic, interactive web pages, and is supported by all modern web browsers.

<h1>Week 8: Fetch jQuery</h1>

During week 8, I learned about Fetch and jQuery. Fetch is a modern JavaScript API for making network requests, including AJAX requests to fetch data from web servers. It uses Promises to handle asynchronous operations, and provides a simpler, more flexible API than older AJAX techniques like XMLHttpRequest. (Promise fetch only rejects when network error is encountered) 

Meanwhile, jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that includes a range of tools for manipulating the DOM, handling events, and making network requests. It includes a simplified AJAX API that provides a shorthand way to make AJAX requests, and handles cross-browser compatibility issues for people.

Both Fetch and jQuery can be used to make network requests in JavaScript, but they have different syntax and capabilities. Fetch is a more modern, standards-based approach, while jQuery provides a more comprehensive suite of tools for front-end development.
  
<h1>Week 9: Bootstrap</h1>

Learnt about Bootstrap:
  
  Heading into Week 9, I learned about Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework used to build mobile-first and responsive websites and web applications. It offers a variety of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, such as navigation menus, buttons, modals, and more, making it easy for people to create professional-looking web pages without requiring extensive CSS or JavaScript knowledge. Bootstrap's grid system is ideal for responsive layouts and is compatible with tools like SASS and LESS.
  
<h1>Week 12: RestDB</h1>

  In Week 12, I was introduced to RestDB, a cloud-based NoSQL database service that provides a web-based interface to design data models and create a RESTful API for web or mobile applications. RestDB's features for managing data, such as filtering, searching, and aggregation, save users time and effort while also supporting popular front-end development frameworks like Angular and React. By using RestDB, people can save time and effort in building their own backend infrastructure, and focus on building great user experiences for their apps.
  
<h1>Week 13: Common mistakes in Assignment 1</h1>

  Week 13 was focused on Assignment 1 mistakes to avoid in Assignment 2, such as ensuring clean file structures and clear READMEs.

<h1>Week 14: Lottie animations</h1>
  
  Finally, in Week 14, I learned about Lottie animations, a library developed by Airbnb that provides designers and developers an easy way to integrate high-quality, lightweight animations into their apps and websites. Lottie utilizes JSON files created in After Effects, containing all the data needed to display complex animations, such as vector shapes and images, on various platforms and programming languages, including iOS, Android, React, and Vue.
  
That's all for my development blog! Thank you
