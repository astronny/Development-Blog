What I have learnt in Interactive Development(ID):

Week 1: What a good website embodies; How to make Replit and Github accounts; What Replit and Github are used for:

I learnt that a good website embodies many factors, some include having a clear and concise message, visually appealing design and easy navigation.

GitHub and Replit are both tools that are used by software developers. GitHub is a website where developers can store their code and work on software projects with other people. It has a lot of cool features, like bug tracking and project management, that make it easy for developers to keep track of what's going on with their projects. And because it uses the Git version control system, developers can see exactly what changes have been made to their code, and by whom.

Replit, on the other hand, is a tool that lets developers write and run code right in their web browser. It has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for developers to get up and running, and it supports a bunch of different programming languages. Developers can work on projects with other people and see what changes have been made because it has built-in support for version control, just like they can on GitHub.

So, in a nutshell, i learnt that GitHub is a place for developers to work on software projects with others, while Replit is a place for developers to write and run their own codes.

Week 2: Semantic CSS

Semantic CSS is a way of writing CSS that makes your code more meaningful and easier to understand. It's like giving your HTML elements labels that describe what they are and what they're used for. By using semantic CSS, i can make my code more organized, easier to maintain, and easier for other people to understand. And because my CSS is more meaningful, it will be easier to make changes and updates to my websites in the future.
